# polyicon

A custom icon set generator from Polymer's icon sets. Normally, you'd load an entire icon set
even if you only use one of its icons in your app. This online tool makes it easy to create
an optimized version with only the icons your application needs.

### Try it

1. Visit [https://poly-icon.appspot.com](https://poly-icon.appspot.com) webpage.
2. Select the icons you want to use in your application.
3. Download the optimized `<iron-iconset-svg>` markup and create an HTML import for it.
4. Load the import in your app and start using!

For example, if your icon set name is "myicons" and the icon you want to use from that set is "hamburger", usage would look like:

    <iron-icon icon="myicons:hamburger"></iron-icon>

Boom!
